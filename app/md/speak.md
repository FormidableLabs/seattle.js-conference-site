## Submitting an Idea

Whether you new to web development or a seasoned pro, you can give a talk at SeattleJS. 

Don't let the name SeattleJS fool you - we welcome people and presentations regardless of which technologies you are excited about using to build on the web. Talks about technologies like the browser platform, CSS, NodeJS, and other languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and PHP are all welcome here!

SeattleJS is a friendly and welcoming group. If you've never presented before or are nervous about public speaking, this is a great community to build up your confidence as a speaker.

### Presentation formats

SeattleJS is equipped to support a few different presentation formats:

- **Lightning talks** are *5-10 minute* sessions that briefly cover a topic. They tend to be more casual, and are a great fit for sharing something new you learned, and interesting problem you solved recently, and other topics that don't require a ton of depth.
- **Tech sessions** are *20-30 minutes* and cover a technical topic in depth. Full sessions are usually accompanied by slides or demos. These should cover a topic in reasonable depth. These are also a great way to test out a topic before submitting or presenting at a conference.
- **Workshops** are *interactive* sessions that are *45 minutes or longer*. In a workshop, the presenter guides the audience through one or more **hands-on coding activities** that they complete on their own computers.

If you've learned something new or have some hard-won wisdom to share, you'll find SeattleJS a warm and welcoming place to speak.

## Delivering Your Talk

Please plan on being at the venue at 5PM - 30 minutes before doors open. We will use this time to do a tech check and make sure you are setup for a smooth presentation. 

Please plan on plugging your laptop directly into an **HDMI port** and bring an adapter if your laptop doesn't have an HDMI port.
