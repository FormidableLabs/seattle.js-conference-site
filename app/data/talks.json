As the sum of human knowledge continues to grow, so too do the challenges of teaching each other what we need to know not only to build toward the future but also to contribute to the tools of its construction. If only it were possible to transfer knowledge from one engineer directly into the minds of other engineers, like a human RAID! Rachel Lee Nabors loves building such mechanisms for knowledge transfer, from video guides to documentation to curricula. In this talk, they will discuss what doesn't work, what has worked on projects like React and React Native, and what can work for any other open source project today. Teaching is hard. But there are solid ways to approach knowledge transfer at scale."
